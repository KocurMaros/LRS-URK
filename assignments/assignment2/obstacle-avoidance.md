# Obstacle avoidance (10 points)

One of the three [Assignment 2](README.md) topics. **Deadline: end of week 12.** See
[`../README.md`](../README.md) for the semester rules and [`README.md`](README.md) for the
rules shared by all three topics (threshold, documentation, git).

## What you are building

Your drone flies from point A to point B along a straight line. Somewhere along that line
there is an obstacle it did not know about when the mission started. You detect it from the
depth camera, decide where to go instead, and fly around it — then carry on to B.

This extends the control node from [Assignment 1](../assignment1/README.md): same node, same MAVROS
setpoints, same position controller. What's new is a perception input (the point cloud) feeding
a decision (replan) back into the thing you already built.

Fly it in the hangar world with the depth camera:
`worlds/fei_lrs_gazebo_depth.world`. It carries a native `rgbd_camera` sensor on the drone
(link `fei_lrs_drone/stereo_cam_link`, gz-transport base topic `fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera`)
publishing colour, depth and — already computed for you — a point cloud. Bring it up like the
other worlds, per the [repository README](../../README.md#running-the-simulation):

```bash
scripts/run_gazebo.sh fei_lrs_gazebo_depth.world
```

### Getting the point cloud into ROS 2

The sensor publishes on **gz-transport**, not ROS 2 — you bridge the topics you need with
`ros_gz_bridge`:

```bash
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge \
  /fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/points@sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2[gz.msgs.PointCloudPacked \
  /fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/image@sensor_msgs/msg/Image[gz.msgs.Image \
  /fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/camera_info@sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo[gz.msgs.CameraInfo
```

The `[` means one-directional, gz → ROS — that's all you need for a sensor. After this,
`ros2 topic list` should show:

```
/fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/points
/fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/image
/fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/camera_info
```

Check it in RViz before writing a line of code: `rviz2`, set **Fixed Frame** to
`fei_lrs_drone/fei_lrs_drone/stereo_cam_link/stereo_camera_depth`, add a `PointCloud2` display
on the `/points` topic. If you see the hangar in 3D, you're ready to subscribe from your own
node.

That frame name looks doubled because it is: gz sim derives it from
`<model>/<link>/<sensor>`, and the link itself is already named `fei_lrs_drone/stereo_cam_link`
in the world file, so `fei_lrs_drone` ends up prefixed twice. Check `ros2 topic echo
/fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/points --field header.frame_id` if RViz shows nothing and you
suspect a frame mismatch — this is the value your own node's TF handling needs too.

### Placing an obstacle

The world has no obstacle on your A → B line; you place one yourself, and at the defence your
teacher places one somewhere you have not tested. It has to be **static**, so it does not fall
over, and **tall enough to cross your flight altitude**. A box inserted from the Gazebo GUI's
shape toolbar is a 1 m cube that drops to the floor, below a typical flight corridor.

With the world running, spawn a static orange box with `scripts/spawn_obstacle.sh`:

```bash
scripts/spawn_obstacle.sh obstacle_1 16 7          # 0.6 × 0.6 × 3 m box at (16, 7)
scripts/spawn_obstacle.sh wall_1 16 7 2 0.6 2.5    # 2 m wide, 0.6 m deep, 2.5 m tall
scripts/spawn_obstacle.sh --remove obstacle_1      # remove it again
```

The arguments are `NAME X Y [WIDTH] [DEPTH] [HEIGHT] [YAW]`; `--help` lists them.

- `X Y` is the box centre in **Gazebo world coordinates**, not your MAVROS local ENU frame. The
  drone spawns at (13, 7) with its depth camera looking along +X, so (16, 7) is 3 m in front of
  it. To check a position, select a model in the Gazebo GUI and read its pose in the Component
  Inspector.
- `WIDTH` is the size along world Y, `DEPTH` along world X, `HEIGHT` upwards. The defaults are
  0.6, 0.6 and 3 m, and the box always stands on the floor. Keep it taller than your flight
  altitude, or the drone simply flies over it.
- `YAW` rotates the box about Z, in radians (`1.5708` is 90°).
- Every name must be unique, and the script refuses one that already exists. To move a box,
  remove it and spawn it again.

The script wraps gz-sim's `/world/<world>/create` and `/world/<world>/remove` services; read it
if you would rather call them yourself.

## Specification

### 1. Point cloud subscriber — 2.0 points

- Subscribe to `/fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/points` (`sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2`) from a ROS
  2 node.
- Use `rclcpp::SensorDataQoS()` — this is a sensor topic, and the default reliable QoS will
  leave your callback silently empty. (See
  [`tutorial/ros2_cheatsheet.md`](../../tutorial/ros2_cheatsheet.md#step-2--subscriber) if that
  bites you.)
- Iterate the cloud and get usable 3D points out of it. `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2Iterator` is
  the standard tool for this — look it up. Iterating the raw byte layout yourself is also fine
  if you'd rather understand it at that level; no more detail than this is given on purpose,
  working out the message layout is part of the assignment.

**Accepted when:** you can print, for an arbitrary frame, the number of points received and the
range of their coordinates.

### 2. Obstacle detection — 3.0 points

Turn "here is a cloud of points" into "there is an obstacle at (x, y, z), yes or no."

- Filter the cloud down to what matters: points inside your flight corridor and inside a
  sensible range (the sensor's simulated clip is 2 cm–300 m with light Gaussian noise —
  discard clearly-noise readings, e.g. anything implausibly close).
- Decide on an **obstacle threshold distance** — the point at which "something is ahead" becomes
  "stop and replan." Don't pick it arbitrarily: derive it from your cruise speed and the
  distance you need to react and turn, the same way [A1.1](../assignment1/01_map_and_path_planning.md)
  derives its inflation radius from the drone's size plus a margin. Write the derivation down.
- **Detection must be stable.** A single stray point should not trigger a replan, and a real
  obstacle should not need ten attempts to notice. A simple approach that works well: require
  the same region to read "occupied" across several consecutive frames before you act on it.
  Some false positives are tolerated; noisy, flickering detections are not.
- **Report it in a way that's checkable**, not just a `std::cout` line: log it with
  `RCLCPP_WARN` including the obstacle's coordinates, and — recommended, not required —
  publish a `visualization_msgs/msg/Marker` at the detected point so it shows up in RViz next
  to your point cloud. This is worth doing even though it isn't scored directly: it is by far
  the fastest way to convince yourself (and, later, your teacher) that detection is correct.

**Accepted when:** you can place an obstacle in the drone's path and get a stable, correctly
positioned detection, with no detections when the path is clear.

### 3. Path replanning in 3D — 2.5 points

Once you know there's an obstacle, decide where to fly instead — with a real avoidance
algorithm, in 3D. Choose one of these approaches, or something of comparable quality agreed
with your teacher first:

- **Map-based replanning:** keep a 3D map of what the camera has seen (a voxel grid or an octree;
  your A1.1 one is a good start) and run a 3D planner on it — A\*, Theta\*, D\* Lite, RRT\* or
  similar — again whenever the current path becomes blocked.
- **Reactive 3D avoidance:** choose the next motion from the obstacles around the drone with a
  method such as 3DVFH+ or a search over motion primitives, with enough memory to get back out of
  a dead end.

A preprogrammed manoeuvre (step sideways, step up, back off) or a potential field with no way
out of a local minimum is not enough for this section.

- **Replan in 3D.** Going around and going over are both legal; when there is no way around, go
  over. Minimum and maximum altitude are parameters. Whichever way the drone goes, it must not
  collide with anything — including the roof, which is about 5.9 m high in the middle of the
  hangar and 4.6 m at the side walls, and the roof beams, which hang down to 4.2 m.
- **Check that the new path is actually free before you commit to it** — the same lesson as
  the hangar's shelving racks in A1.1: space that merely "looks clear" because nothing was
  detected there yet is not the same as space that has been verified clear. The camera only
  looks forward, so fly nose-first and turn to look before moving sideways.
- This section can be demonstrated **without flying**: show the replanned path given a
  recorded or a live cloud (for a reactive method, its output stepped forward on the map), and
  show it is collision-free.

Test your algorithm on these four situations. At the defence your teacher sets up one of them,
possibly with a different position or size. The examples use a route from A = (13.5, 1.5, 1.5)
to B = (13.5, 11.0, 1.5) through the open part of the hangar; fly to A first, then place the
obstacles, because some of them stand where the drone spawns.

| Situation | What it forces | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Pillar** | Around, either side — it nearly reaches the roof | `scripts/spawn_obstacle.sh pillar 13.5 6 0.6 0.6 5.5` |
| **Low wall** | Over — it spans the hangar wall to wall | `scripts/spawn_obstacle.sh low_wall 8.75 5 0.3 19 2` |
| **Wall with a gap** | Around, through the only opening | `scripts/spawn_obstacle.sh gap_wall 7.25 8 0.3 15.5 5.5` |
| **U-trap** | Past a cup that opens toward A | `u_back 13.5 8 0.3 3.3 5.5`, `u_left 12 7 2 0.3 5.5`, `u_right 15 7 2 0.3 5.5` |

**Accepted when:** for the situation your teacher sets up, placed where you have not tested
before, your node produces a collision-free 3D path past it — around, through the gap, over, or
out of the U-trap, as the situation requires — and you can explain how your algorithm works.

### 4. Flight with replanning — 2.5 points

Put it together: fly the straight line from A to B, detect the obstacle in flight, replan, fly
past it, and continue to B — autonomously, no manual intervention after start.

- You may assume the drone starts already at point A — you do not have to fly there first.
- The path between A and B is a straight line; the obstacle sits on it.
- After clearing the obstacle, the drone must resume progress toward B, not stop at the
  avoidance point.

**Accepted when:** the complete A → B flight, with a previously-unseen obstacle placement,
succeeds unattended and without a collision.

## Point staging

The four sections above are also staged milestones — each one only pays out if the ones before
it are demonstrated, per the [Assignment 2 rules](README.md#rules-common-to-all-topics):

| Demonstrated | Points | % |
|---|---|---|
| §1 only | 2.0 | 20 % |
| §1 + §2 (stable detection) | 5.0 | 50 % |
| §1 + §2 + §3 (3D replanning, not flown) | 7.5 | 75 % |
| All four (flown, autonomous) | 10.0 | 100 % |

There is **no separate Assignment 2 pass mark** — none of the milestones above is a minimum.
The only gate is the one to sit the final test: **Assignment 1 + Assignment 2 combined**, 56 % of
30, at least **16.8 / 30** — see [`../README.md`](../README.md#grading). How many points you need
here therefore depends on what you scored on Assignment 1.

## Hints

- **Get the pipeline working with a static drone first.** Hover in place, put an obstacle in
  front of the camera, confirm detection and the replanned point in RViz. Only then put it in
  motion. Debugging perception and flight control at the same time is much harder than either
  alone.
- **Record a rosbag of the point cloud** (`ros2 bag record /fei_lrs_drone/stereo_camera/points`)
  once your detector is halfway working. Replaying a bag is far faster to iterate on than
  restarting Gazebo every time.
- The depth image is genuinely noisy — that's the simulated sensor's Gaussian noise, not a bug
  in your code. Filtering has to tolerate it; don't chase a threshold that only works on a
  noise-free frame.
- Keep the obstacle-detection code and the flight-control code in **separate callback groups**
  (see [`mt_executor_demo`](../../mt_executor_demo/README.md)) — a cloud with hundreds of
  thousands of points takes real processing time, and it must never stall your setpoint
  publisher.

## Deliverables

- ROS 2 package(s) building with `colcon build`, extending your Assignment 1 control node.
- The `ros_gz_bridge` command(s) needed, documented in your README.
- Documentation per [`README.md`](README.md#rules-common-to-all-topics): your detection
  threshold and how you derived it, your replanning strategy, pros/cons, a diagram of the
  perception → decision → control data flow.
- Rosbag or screen recording of a complete A → B flight with an obstacle in the path.
